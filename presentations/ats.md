[<img src="../images/back.png">](../README.md)

## Introduction
An **applicant tracking system (ATS)** is software that streamlines the hiring process for organizations. When you submit a job application online, an ATS scans your resume to extract details like skills, job titles, and certifications.
This page is about how to format an ATS-friendly resume and how to optimize resume content for ATS scans.

### Key takeaways to producing ATS compliant Resumes
- An ATS resume must be easy for software to scan with simple formatting.
- Avoid unnecessarily detailed layouts and use clear headings like “Work experience” and “Skills.”
- ATS software prioritizes relevant keywords from the job posting to match qualified candidates.

### Make Your LinkedIn Profile ATS-Friendly
1. **Use Relevant Keywords:**
   Keywords are crucial for ATS systems to identify your profile as a match for job openings. Review job descriptions in your field and incorporate relevant keywords into your headline, summary, experience, and skills sections. Use variations of industry-specific terms and skills to maximize visibility.
2. **Optimize Your Headline and Summary:**
   Your headline and summary are prime real estate on your LinkedIn profile. Craft a headline that includes your current job title and key skills. In your summary, highlight your professional background, key achievements, and career goals using targeted keywords. This helps ATS systems quickly grasp your qualifications.
3. **Complete Your Experience Section:**
   Ensure your experience section is comprehensive and up-to-date. List your job titles, company names, employment dates, and key responsibilities using bullet points. Focus on quantifiable achievements and outcomes to demonstrate your impact in previous roles. This not only impresses human readers but also ATS algorithms.
4. **Highlight Skills and Endorsements:**
   List your skills prominently on your profile, and seek endorsements from connections. ATS systems often prioritize profiles with verified skills relevant to the job. Include a mix of hard skills (e.g., software proficiency) and soft skills (e.g., leadership, communication) to showcase your full range of abilities.
5. **Education and Certifications:**
   Include your educational background and any relevant certifications or licenses. ATS systems may filter profiles based on educational requirements, so ensure this information is accurate and complete.
6. **Customize Your URL:**
   Customize your LinkedIn profile URL to include your name or professional title. A clean, customized URL looks professional and is easier for ATS systems to process.
7. **Engage with Relevant Content:**
   Engage with industry-related content on LinkedIn by liking, commenting, and sharing posts. Active engagement can increase your profile's visibility and demonstrate your knowledge and interest in your field.
8. **Keep Your Profile Updated:**
   Regularly update your LinkedIn profile with new skills, accomplishments, and career developments. This keeps your profile current and ensures that ATS systems and recruiters see your most relevant information.
9. **Use LinkedIn’s Job Application Feature:**
   When applying for jobs through LinkedIn, use the platform's job application feature. This ensures that your profile is formatted correctly for ATS systems used by employers posting jobs on LinkedIn.
10. **Seek Professional Help:**
    Consider utilizing professional resume services to optimize your LinkedIn profile further and ensure it meets ATS requirements. Services like Resume services can provide expert guidance on crafting a compelling LinkedIn profile that stands out to both ATS systems and hiring managers.
