# About RAG 
Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are trained on public internet data that was available at the point in time when they were trained (See the knowledge cut-off dates for various large language models (LLM)). They can answer questions related to the data they were trained on. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a smart way to improve how AI systems answer questions or create content by combining two steps: retrieving useful information and generating responses. Instead of just relying on what the AI knows, RAG pulls in extra data that helps the system understand the question better and provide more accurate, context-aware answers. This demo provides that extra data by pulling stocks, forex and other financial assets from twelvedata.com over REST API and stores that data as vectors (text data converted to number sequences using an embedding model) on Azure AI Search.
## Benefits and Applications of RAG
- Improved privacy: You can use data that the AI wasn’t trained on, meaning you don’t have to worry about the AI knowing sensitive information beforehand.
- Better context: The system can pull in relevant information to understand the user’s question more deeply.
- Higher accuracy: By looking up information, RAG helps reduce mistakes (when AI makes up things) by using real facts.
- Flexible applications: It can be used for various tasks like answering questions and more importantly autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user, aka the [AI Agent pattern](https://blog.whiteprompt.com/mastering-ai-patterns-architectures-knowledge-systems-and-multi-agent-approaches-386064c4bc5a). Tools in this category can be used to take action in a software system, such as sending an email, creating a new record in a database, submitting a form, or triggering a workflow.
  The goal is to automate tasks that would otherwise require human intervention or explicit programming.
