# What are Small Language Models
[<img src="../images/back.png">](../presentation)

### What are they
- Small language models (SLMs) are a subset of language models to perform specific tasks using fewer resources.
- A Model that you can customize, or fine-tune, with your own data within a reasonable time with currently available hardware.
- Lower costs and improved performance for domain-specific applications, particular useful in the field of Vertical AI Agents.
- Built with fewer parameters than large language models (LLMs), faster training, reduced energy consumption, and deployment on devices with limited resources.

### Small vs Large
- Efficiency
  - Donâ€™t need the massive computational power that LLMs demand.
  - Require less computational power, great for use on devices with limited resources
  - Ideal for environments with limited resources.
- Decreased training time
  - Train faster than larger ones.
  - Accelerating the development time.
  - Faster deployment and testing of new applications.
- Improved accuracy
  - Training is focused on specific tasks.
  - Providing more accurate responses and information within the areas they are trained in.
  - Allows fine-tuning that often outperforms larger models in case of domain-specific needs (vertical Agents again).
- Accessibility
  - Reduced computational requirements.
  - Well suited for on-premise deployments where privacy and data security are very important
  - Limited budgets can implement SLMs without needing high-end infrastructure, not necessary rely on cloud-based infrastructure.
- Faster inference 
  - Quicker response times because they have fewer parameters to process
  - Fit perfectly fast decisions are essential.
  - Great for environments where low latency is a must.

### Task complexity (*why SLMs fits well on Vertical AI Agent pattern*)

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capable handling complex, sophisticated, and general tasks                        | Well suited for more adequate, simpler tasks                                  |
| Better accuracy and performance across different tasks                            | Good at specialized applications and domain-specific tasks                    |
| Capable of maintaining context over long passages and providing coherent response | May struggle with complex language tasks and long-range context understanding |
