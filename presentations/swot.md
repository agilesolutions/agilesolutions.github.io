## Introduction
Understanding your strengths and weaknesses can help you identify opportunities and threats in your personal and professional life. A great way to understand yourself better is by completing a Personal SWOT Analysis. A SWOT Analysis assesses your **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats*, and by doing this analysis, you can gain clarity on what steps you should take to reach your goals.

## What is SWOT Analysis?
SWOT Analysis is a technique used by **individuals** (or businesses) to assess their **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats**.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses are internal factors** – a company’s resources, capabilities, and skills. These are the aspects of the company that it can control. Strengths refer to resources and capabilities that give the company a competitive advantage. At the same time, weaknesses are those aspects of the company that put it at a disadvantage in comparison to its competitors.
- **Opportunities and Threats are external factors** – they are external forces that the company has no control over.

###2. Identify Your Weaknesses
Identifying your weaknesses for doing a personal SWOT analysis can be a difficult task, but it is a necessary part of the process.
*The first step to identifying your weaknesses is to take an honest look at yourself. Ask yourself questions such as:*
- What do I need to improve on?
- What areas of my life can I work on?

**Common weaknesses**
- Lack of knowledge and skills.
- Lack of confidence (It is important to identify the root of this lack of confidence and to work on building it up. This can be done through practice, self-reflection, and seeking out feedback.)

###3. Identify Your Opportunities
1. Make a List of Areas You Can Improve. Start by making a list of areas where you can improve. This could be anything from learning a new skill, taking a class, or improving your relationship with a colleague.
2. Ask Other People for Their Suggestions. Once you’ve made your own list of opportunities and threats, it can be helpful to get feedback from others.

###4. Identify Your Threats
Threats are external factors that can have an adverse effect on your personal and professional goals.  Examples of threats may include competitors, economic downturns, changes in technology.
1. Make a List of Potential Obstacles. Start by making a list of potential obstacles that could prevent you from achieving your goals. Think about both external and internal threats. External threats could include economic downturns, competition. Internal threats could include things like a lack of resources, lack of knowledge, or limited time.
2. Ask Other People for Their Opinions. You can also ask people who have similar goals or have achieved similar successes to see what obstacles they encountered.

## My Personal SWOT Analysis.
###1. Strengths
- **Communication:** Positive, open, clear, transparent. Respect for other opinions (Best Idea wins Principal). Sharing knowledge the best I can to help team members. Always offering a helping hand once needed. Simply friendly in communication to other.
- **Problem-Solving:** Nose for research, good at identifying issues and bringing up resolutions, first sharing that with the team to open discuss alternatives. Actually I never give up until I found the solution, but always try to pull in expertise once I feel I need it to progress on the issue and are potentially stuck (never wait too long).
- **Leadership:**
- **Organization:** 
- **Creativity:**
- **Adaptibility:**
- **Resilience:**
###2. Weaknesses
- **Lack of knowledge:** Not really applicable, simply do not apply for contract assignments if you feel you are lacking practical experiences.
###3. Opportunities
- **New developments:** new technology developments like AI agentic and AI on cloud will let companies start new initiatives and potential start new projects, and so new job openings. Focused my studies on this topic so that I can benefit from this development.
- 
###4. Threats
- **My age:**, most likely companies will not offer me a permanent job. Most companies are seeking for long term commitments, specifically in areas of new technologies where they feel they have to long-term invest in people. I have to stay with temporary assignments, this is what I did since 1991.
