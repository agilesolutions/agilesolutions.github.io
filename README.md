# About my future objectives
At the moment my main focus is on experimenting with AI Agent enabling existing business running with SpringBoot on Azure kubernetes. Everything related to AI development I studied so far is worked into [one Github showcase project](https://github.com/agilesolutions/spring-azure-ai/). 
## Technology stack
- SpringBoot application microservice exposing REST API end-pionts to triggering demonstrated logic.
- Spring AI
  - Connecting Azure Search Vector database to demonstrating RAG
  - Tool Calling, demonstrating Agentic AI. The goal is to automate that would otherwise require human intervention or explicit programming. For example, a tool can be used to book a flight for a customer interacting with a chatbot, to fill out a form on a web page, or automatically generate an order in an OMS order management system.
- Terraform configuration files to provisioning all Azure infrastructure components needed to run this demo in its full context. That includes a full Azure Kubernetes AKS cluster and Azure AI Foundry HUB, project and finally deploying gpt-4 LLM model.
- Gradle scripts build to compile, test and package to a deployable archive.
- Docker and HELM chart artifacts to providing Kubernetes manifests and deploy this solution onto Azure AKS.
- CI/CD ADO Azure DevOps Pipeline - Fully automated build package and deployment with Azure DevOps.
- Scalable & Cloud-Native - Deployable on Azure App Service or Kubernetes.
- Centralized Logging (Azure Monitor, Application Insights)
- Monitoring & Alerts (Azure Monitor, Prometheus/Grafana)
- Security Best Practices (Key Vault for secrets, RBAC, Network Policies)
