## Introduction
SMART goals are short-term, strategic actions to develop your long-term vision of success and strategy. The acronym SMART – **Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Responsible, and Time-Bound** – helps to build your actionable goals to help it reach its long-term destination.

- **Specific** – What needs to be accomplished? Who’s responsible for it? What steps need to be taken to achieve it?
- **Measurable** – How will you measure success? Specificity is a solid start, but quantifying your goals (that is, making sure they’re measurable) makes it easier to track progress and know when you’ve reached the finish line.
- **Attainable (achievable)** – Ask yourself: is your objective something you can reasonably accomplish?
- **Relevant** – A relevant objective makes sense, is there a need for the things you are developing, does this fit on your long-term strategy roadmap.
- **Time-Bound** – To properly measure success, you need to have an estimate on when your goal has been reached. What’s your time horizon?
- **Rewarded** - ?
