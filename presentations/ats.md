## Introduction
An applicant tracking system (ATS) is software that streamlines the hiring process for organizations. When you submit a job application online, an ATS scans your resume to extract details like skills, job titles, and certifications.
This page is about how to format an ATS-friendly resume and how to optimize resume content for ATS scans.

### Key takeaways to producing ATS compliant Resumes
- An ATS resume must be easy for software to scan with simple formatting.
- Avoid unnecessarily detailed layouts and use clear headings like “Work experience” and “Skills.”
- ATS software prioritizes relevant keywords from the job posting to match qualified candidates.
