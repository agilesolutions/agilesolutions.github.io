[<img src="../images/back.png">](../README.md)

## Introduction
- You can use the STAR method to structure the examples you give to questions, especially in interviews.
- Structure your working history on CV or LinkedIn
- and so on...

### What STAR stands for
- **Situation** - the situation you had to deal with
- **Task** - the task you were given to do
- **Action** - the action you took
- **Result** - what happened as a result of your action and what you learned from the experience

### Story no 1.
- **Situation** - Project X was lacking fully automated regression testing for all services participating on Quarterly runs. At the moment too many bugs slipped through to higher order environments like UAT, and Production.
- **Task** - The project team decided to implement a fully automated End-to-End regression and QA testing pipeline, scheduled each night to test and filter out potential programming bugs, preventing these problems to causing disruption on production environments.   
- **Action** - After having presented my design proposal to the team I worked out a solution to have a set of integration tests running on nightly build and test pipelines. These QA tests were designed against pre-defined data sets to provide a full test coverage of all logic under development.
Details on failing tests were directly reported on a dedicated Teams Channel from where developers could see the results early morning.
- **Result** - This resulted in the following overall organizational performance improvements. 
  - The overall nightly tests provided a quality gate preventing bugs slipping through into UAT and production releases. The project could now release with a higher frequency with the confident feeling that potential bugs were filtered out.
  - Leveraged a higher level of awareness with developers to put more emphasis and energy on individual testing before delivering there efforts into the next release.
  - My solution resulted in a overall higher level of stability of software delivered at the end of a Scrum Sprint.
