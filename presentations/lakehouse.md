### Case for Data Lakehouses
Data Management (DM) are the techniques and tools for managing data consistently across a company. 
Data warehousing is a component of DM that focuses on storing and analyzing structured data. Data lakes support unstructured data through file formats. 

The need for performing analytics on all types of data across multiple data sources, as well as running end-to-end AI and business intelligence (BI) puts high demands on DM.

DM has evolved over time, traditional solutions fall short, this is where data lakehouse architecture as emerged as a modern standard for DM and data warehousing.
