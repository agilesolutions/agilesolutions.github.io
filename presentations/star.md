# The STAR method
[<img src="../images/back.png">](../README.md)

## Introduction
- You can use the STAR method to structure the examples you give to questions, especially in interviews.
- Structure your working history on CV or LinkedIn
- and so on...

### What STAR stands for
- **Situation** - the situation you had to deal with
- **Task** - the task you were given to do
- **Action** - the action you took
- **Result** - what happened as a result of your action and what you learned from the experience

### Star Template
- **Situation:** 1-2 sentences
- **Task:** 2-3 sentences
- **Action:** 3-4 sentences
- **Result:** 2-3 

### Example 
Think of a real life example of when you had to manage challenging stakeholders. Diffuse the story into 4 sections. Max 10 sentences!
- **SITUATION:** 1-2 sentences, OVERVIEW, FACTS. The project was over budget when I took over….
- **TASK:** 2-3 sentences, PLAN, COURSE OF ACTION. I gathered the team for a quick audit, decided to….
- **ACTIONS:** 3-4 sentences, ACTIONS, «I»-STATEMENTS. I reached out to every SH individually first, for a …..
- **RESULTS:** 2-3 sentences, FACTS, FIGURES. I gained an extended timeline and a larger budget to combine another project into ours. In the end….

### Story no 1.
- **Situation** - Project X was lacking fully automated regression testing for all services participating on Quarterly runs. At the moment too many bugs slipped through to higher order environments like UAT, and Production.
- **Task** - I was assigned the task to implement a fully automated End-to-End regression and QA testing pipeline, scheduled each night to test and filter out potential programming bugs, preventing these problems to causing disruption on production environments.   
- **Action** - After having presented my design proposal to the team I worked out a solution to have a set of integration tests running on nightly build and test pipelines. These QA tests were designed against pre-defined data sets to provide a full test coverage of all logic under development.
Details on failing tests were directly reported on a dedicated Teams Channel from where developers could see the results early morning.
- **Result** - This resulted in the following overall organizational performance improvements. 
  - The overall nightly tests provided a quality gate preventing bugs slipping through into UAT and production releases. The project could now release with a higher frequency with the confident feeling that potential bugs were filtered out.
  - Leveraged a higher level of awareness with developers to put more emphasis and energy on individual testing before delivering there efforts into the next release.
  - My solution resulted in an overall higher level of stability of software delivered at the end of a Scrum Sprint.

### Story no 2.
- **Situation** - Bank X was looking for a solution to automating the deployment of core banking solutions running on Linux OS. That overall process needed to get reduced from days to hours. (This was before containerization technologies era.) 
- **Task** - In my role as Solution Architect I researched different alternatives and finally proposed to Management and Red Hat Architects to use their Satellite provisioning tool and RPM software packaging solution to deploying banking solutions. Initially this facility was designed to allow RH engineers to deploy, configure and maintain their core Linux platforms. After presentations to the management my proposal was approved. I was assigned the task to design and implement the solution as proposed in my presentation. 
- **Action** - I Developed an 3-tier (UI, logic and DB) Application enabling operations to configure banking applications. That same application used RH Satellite provisioning and RPM packaging tools to distribute complex Banking Enterprise applications with one simple key-click, instead of hours manual configuration and testing. 
- **Result** - The bank decided to introduce Temenos T24 as its core banking platform on its branch in Singapore. Without the solution described above an average release cycle would have taken up a whole weekend. With the introduction of the automation solution that was reduced to hours. 

### Story no 3
- **Situation** - Bank X was slowly getting behind on latest state of technologies related to containerization. However, meanwhile Agile development practises were emerging, demanding continuous integration, delivery and deployment facilities.
- **Task** - In my role as Solution Architect I studied Container technologies and container orchestration and scheduling platforms like Red Hat Openshift. I proposed to the Management and Red Hat Architecture to start a POC project with SWOT analysis. My proposal and budget got approved. My task was to organize a 3 weeks POC project with RH architects together and providing an end presentation to the management.  
- **Action** - RH engineers deployed a full OpenShift Kubernetes cluster as a preparation to get started with that POC. I provided the technology to containerizing one of the banking solutions and run misc deployment scenarios from Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and conducted a full SWOT analysis, compiling the results on an end presentation.  
- **Result** - After that end presentation it was decided to initiate the first Openshift Kubernetes cluster on the bank. For RH this was supposed to be the first OpenShift implementation with a Swiss Bank. This POC initiative opened the doors to a company-wide rollout of container technology.
