## Introduction
The purpose of Diversification is to spread out risk and opportunities over a larger set of businesses. Diversification can occur either at the business unit level or at the corporate level.

1. **concentric diversification:** where the new business produces products that are technically similar to the company’s current product but that appeal to a new consumer group
2. **horizontal diversification:** where the new business produces products that are totally unrelated to the company’s current product but that appeal to the same consumer group
3. **conglomerate diversification:** where the new business produces products that are totally unrelated to the company’s current product and that appeal to an entirely new consumer group.

## SWOT :
SWOT analysis sometimes known as SLOT analysis is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses and Limitations, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business venture.
It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective

- **Strengths:** characteristics of the business, or project team that give it an advantage over others
- **Weaknesses (or Limitations):** are characteristics that place the team at a disadvantage relative to others
- **Opportunities:** external chances to improve performance in the environment. For example to make the company more money
- **Threats:** external elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project
