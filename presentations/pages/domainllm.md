# Domain Specific LLM
[<img src="../images/back.png">](../presentation)

### What makes domain-driven Models different from general-purpose LLM's
- LLM that is trained or fine-tuned to execute tasks to matching your business requirements and policies.
- Unlike general-purpose LLM, domain-specific LLMs are designed to service a specific purpose on domain specific applications.

### Key benefits of domain-specific LLMs (Referenced from [Google Cloud: Domain-specific AI apps](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/three-step-design-pattern-for-specializing-llms?hl=en))
- Precision and expertise
  - Fine-tuned on datasets from specialized domains, enabling generating results that are not only accurate but also more relevant to a specific business
  - General models lack the ability to understand specific contexts beyond the vast datasets they were trained on.
  - General-purpose LLMs may occasionally generate incorrect information, referred to as hallucinations.
  - Since generic LLMs lack expertise in any specific domain, their information on niche topics may be overly generalized or inaccurate, limiting their suitability for specialized tasks.
  - Due to their extensive data requirements, training and using general-purpose LLMs can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, making them less convenient for many applications.
- Enhanced reliability
  - Through their narrowed focus, these models are less vulnerable to external and irrelevant information. 
  - Ensuring more consistent and reliable outputs.
- Safety and liability
  - Domain-specific LLMs, often embedded with additional safety mechanisms, can deliver more trustworthy insights.
- Model efficiency
  - Instead of relying on a massive general-purpose model, it's often more efficient to fine-tune a smaller model on a domain-specific dataset.
  - This smaller model can offer higher quality outputs at a significantly lower cost.
